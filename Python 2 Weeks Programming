Week 1: Foundation in Python Programming
The first week will be about mastering Python basics, working with data types, functions, loops, and conditions. These will be fundamental to both web scraping and double verification tasks.

Day 1: Introduction to Python & Setting Up the Environment
Goal: Get Python installed and write your first Python program.


Topics:
Install Python (Python 3.x) and set up a development environment (IDE like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code).
Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks (optional but helpful for experimenting).
Running your first Python script: print("Hello, World!").
Python Syntax and Structure:
Indentation (white spaces and tabs).
Comments (#).
Basic Input and Output (input(), print()).
Practice: Write simple programs like a basic calculator or a program to print your name.


Day 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
Goal: Understand how to work with different data types in Python.

Topics:
Variables: Naming conventions, assigning values.
Data Types: Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans.
Type Conversion: int(), float(), str().
Operators: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), Comparison (==, !=, >, <), Logical (and, or, not).
Practice: Write programs to calculate the area of shapes, check if a number is even/odd, etc.


Day 3: Control Flow – Conditional Statements
Goal: Learn how to make decisions in your code.

Topics:
if, elif, and else statements.
Comparison operators (==, >, <, <=, >=).
Logical operators for compound conditions.
Practice: Create a program that asks the user for their age and outputs a message based on different age groups (child, teenager, adult).


Day 4: Loops (for and while loops)
Goal: Learn how to repeat tasks efficiently.

Topics:
for loop: Iterating over lists, ranges, strings.
while loop: Repeating until a condition is met.
Nested loops (loop inside loop).
Break, continue, and pass statements.
Practice: Write programs that calculate factorials, sum of numbers, or generate multiplication tables.


Day 5: Functions & Modules
Goal: Learn how to create reusable blocks of code.

Topics:
Defining functions (def), function arguments, and return values.
Function scope (local vs global variables).
Importing standard libraries (like math, random).
Writing your own modules.
Practice: Write functions to solve specific problems (e.g., check prime numbers, generate Fibonacci series).


Day 6: Lists & Dictionaries (Data Structures)
Goal: Learn how to store and manipulate collections of data.

Topics:
Lists: Creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over lists.
List comprehensions for concise code.
Dictionaries: Keys and values, adding/updating/removing items.
Working with list() and dict() functions.
Practice: Create a simple contact book (with dictionaries) or a list of student grades.


Day 7: Review and Project 1
Goal: Consolidate what you have learned.

Topics:
Review key concepts from Day 1 to Day 6.
Simple project to reinforce concepts.
Project: Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers, removes duplicates, sorts them, and calculates the average. This will involve lists, loops, functions, and basic control flow.







Week 2: Data Scraping and Verification
In the second week, we will focus on data scraping techniques, the libraries involved, and techniques for verifying and cleaning data.

Day 8: Introduction to Web Scraping & HTTP Requests
Goal: Learn how to fetch data from websites.

Topics:
What is web scraping and why it is useful.
HTTP Protocol: Understanding requests and responses.
Install and use requests library to make HTTP GET/POST requests.
Inspecting HTML structure of web pages (using browser developer tools).
Practice: Make a simple HTTP request to a website and parse the response.


Day 9: Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup
Goal: Learn how to extract data from HTML.
Topics:
Install and use the BeautifulSoup library.
Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup: find elements (find(), find_all()).
Extract data from tags and attributes (e.g., links, images).
Navigating the parse tree.
Practice: Write a scraper to extract headlines or links from a news website.


Day 10: Handling Errors and Data Cleaning
Goal: Learn how to handle errors and clean data.

Topics:
Error handling with try, except, and finally.
Common scraping issues: handling missing data, invalid URLs, etc.
Cleaning data (removing unwanted characters, trimming spaces).
Use of regular expressions (re module) for pattern matching.
Practice: Build a scraper that deals with missing data or malformed HTML.


Day 11: Scraping Dynamic Websites (Selenium)
Goal: Learn how to scrape content from dynamic websites.

Topics:
Introduction to Selenium and why it is used.
Automating a browser to interact with JavaScript-driven websites.
Scraping data after JavaScript content is loaded.
Working with elements in Selenium (find_element_by_xpath, click(), etc.).
Practice: Write a scraper that interacts with a website’s buttons and extracts data from a dynamic page.




Day 12: Data Storage and Exporting
Goal: Learn how to store and export scraped data.
Topics:
Saving scraped data into CSV files using csv library.
Storing data into SQLite databases.
Working with JSON data: parsing and storing in .json files.
Practice: Write a script to scrape data from a site and store the results in a CSV or JSON file.


Day 13: Double Verification Techniques
Goal: Learn how to verify data across multiple sources.

Topics:
What is double verification and why is it important for data quality.
Comparing data between two websites.
Using APIs to verify the authenticity of data.
Handling discrepancies and exceptions.
Practice: Build a program that scrapes data from two different websites and cross-checks them for consistency.


Day 14: Final Project – Web Scraping + Double Verification

Goal: Apply all the skills learned in a real-world project.
Project: Build a comprehensive scraper that:
Scrapes data from one or more websites.
Verifies the accuracy of the data by cross-checking with another source (API or other website).
Cleans, stores, and possibly exports the data (CSV/JSON).
Presentation: Prepare a short report on your findings or challenges faced during the scraping process.
